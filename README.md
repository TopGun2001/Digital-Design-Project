 # Digital-Design-Project

 I used Xilinx Basys 3 development board to create a Mouse Audio Display - Digital System. 

 
 I also utilised external components like: Pmod MIC, Pmod OLED, Pmod Speaker, Computer Mouse.                      

Please refer to the user guide on how the FPGA is programmed.
