 # Digital-Design-Project

 I used Xilinx Basys 3 development board to create a Mouse Audio Display - Digital System. 
 I also utilised external components like:
                                          1. Pmod MIC
                                          2. Pmod OLED
                                          3. Pmod Speaker
                                          4. Computer Mouse                      

Please refer to the user guide on how the FPGA is programmed.
